# AI Project 7: Learning Tools on Automatic Speech Recognition

This repository contains learning resources for one area of AI that I'm personally interested in: Automatic Speech Recognition. It contains a slide deck with content (background, architectures, algorithms), links to many external resources, and hands-on activities to enhance learning. It also contains a Jupyter notebook (which the slide deck references) for one of the activities: using an ASR model (Whisper) in Python.

The goals of this lecture/portfolio are for students to
1. Gain a higher-level understanding of ASR, which is a cool interdisciplinary area of AI that uses many of the more complex topics covered during the semester (deep learning, NLP, reinforcement learning).
2. Explore Whisper in action. Understand how to use/manipulate these models from a developer's perspective.
3. Provide the incentive + opportunity for interested students to learn more about this topic through linked resources.

I envision this topic would fit in the course after the lecture/quiz on NLP, or at the very end of the semester as an "applications" topic.
